An in-house analysis for the phytochemical classes of flavonoids (rutin, RT; quercetin, QT; luteolin, LT; kaempferol, KF) and alkaloid (trigonelline, TG) was performed for the seed extracts.<h4>Results</h4>A lower IC<sub>50</sub> value (14.7 \u00b1 1.46 \u00b5g/mL) was recorded for the IR3M extract against the HT29, MCF7 (13.03 \u00b1 1.95 \u00b5g/mL), and MRC5 (14.58 \u00b1 2.92 \u00b5g/mL) cell line. The extract with the lower IC<sub>50</sub> value (8.17 \u00b1 0.73 \u00b5g/mL) against HepG2 was IR2M. For the antimicrobial activity, a lower MIC value (6.3 mg/mL) was observed for E2C, E2M, E3C, and I3H extracts against SF and for the E1M, Y3C, IR2H, IR3H, and IR3C extracts against SA. The lowest MBC value (12.5 mg/mL) was seen for E2C, E2M, E3C, and I3H against SF as well as for the extracts E1M, Y3C, IR2H, IR3H, and IR3C against SA. The extracts of Q1H (49.07 \u00b1 2.45 \u00b5g/mL) and Y3C (43.65 \u00b1 2.97 \u00b5g/mL) exhibited IC<sub>50</sub> values comparable to the standard drugs tested for \u03b1-amylase inhibition. The statistical models were of Pearson's correlation. Principal component analysis (PCA) and a paired <i>t</i>-test established a strong positive correlation for the FV (QT, KF, LT) and alkaloid (TG) (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in the biological activities (cytotoxicity, antimicrobial, and \u03b1-amylase inhibition), thereby suggesting a substantial role for these phytochemical classes in the traditional and medicinal uses of fenugreek seeds.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The FV and alkaloid are the key to impart the biological properties to the fenugreek seeds, hence their presence is utmost in the fenugreek seeds.
