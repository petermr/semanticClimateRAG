This shrub inhibits understory herbaceous plant recruitment and establishment, thereby exposing soils to erosion, owing potentially to toxins it secretes. However, the allelochemicals of <i>E. floribundus</i> and their potential effects on the germination and establishment of plants remains poorly understood. We investigated the phytochemical classes of leaves and twigs of <i>E. floribundus</i> and evaluated the effects of extracts from these plant parts on seed germination and seedling growth of <i>Lactuca sativa</i> through a laboratory experiment. In the laboratory, we analysed phytochemicals in leaf and twig extracts and tested their allelopathic effects on <i>Lactuca sativa</i> seed germination and growth using the Petri dish method. In this proof-of-concept study, we identified 12 phytochemical classes of <i>E. floribundus</i>. Quantitative analysis showed that the leaves had significantly higher levels of flavonoids, phenolics, and tannins than twigs. As a result, leaf extracts caused 100% inhibition of seed germination, while twig extracts inhibited seed germination by 90% at 50 g L<sup>-1</sup>. Both leaf and twig extracts also significantly reduced radicle and plumule growth, with a stronger effect observed from the leaves than twigs. This study provides new insights into the phytochemical composition and strong allelopathic potential of <i>E. floribundus</i>, contributing to a better understanding of the mechanisms driving its encroachment in semi-arid grasslands.", "affiliation": "Department of Plant Production, Soil Science & Agricultural Engineering, School of Agriculture & Environmental Sciences, University of Limpopo, Private Bag X1106, Sovenga, Polokwane 0727, South Africa.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": {"grantId": "129426", "agency": "National Research Foundation (NRF-BAAP) of South Africa", "orderIn": "0"}}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Bioactivity", "Allelopathy", "Lactuca sativa", "Phytochemicals", "Euryops Floribundus"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/plants14040601"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11859777"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11859777?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2025-02-26", "firstIndexDate": "2025-02-27", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2025-03-07", "dateOfRevision": "2025-02-28", "electronicPublicationDate": "2025-02-17", "firstPublicationDate": "2025-02-17"}
