For both managed and natural systems, understanding how extreme weather events, such as droughts, floods, and extreme wind, affect phytochemical diversity is an important part of predicting responses of plant-arthropod interactions to climate change. In an outdoor field experiment with two distinct varieties of hemp (<i>Cannabis sativa</i> L., Cannabaceae), we investigated the effects of simulated water stress from reduced water availability and flooding, along with an unplanned extreme wind event on phytochemical diversity and cannabinoid profiles. We also examined how changes in chemistry affected the diversity of the associated arthropods. Our results indicate that both genetic variety and environmental stress have substantial effects on variation in hemp phytochemical diversity and cannabinoid composition, and these effects cascaded to alter the arthropod communities on flowers. The largest differences in chemistry were found between different varieties, which accounted for over 10% of the variation in phytochemical diversity. Stress from wind and floods reduced the phytochemical diversity of flowers, wind had negative effects on cannabidiol (CBD) concentrations, and both water deficit and flooding caused subtle shifts in cannabinoid composition. The subsequent cascading effects of chemistry depended on how it was characterized, with increases in CBD causing higher arthropod richness, while increased phytochemical diversity reduced arthropod diversity. These results provide insights into the potential effects of extreme weather on hemp chemistry, as well as the consequences of hemp phytochemical diversity on colonizing arthropods.", "affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Nevada Reno, 1664 N Virginia St., Reno, NV 89557, USA.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Drought stress", "Hemp", "Cannabinoids", "CBD", "Arthropod Diversity", "Flood Stress", "Phytochemical Diversity"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/plants14030474"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11819868"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11819868?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2025-02-13", "firstIndexDate": "2025-02-14", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2025-02-18", "dateOfRevision": "2025-02-15", "electronicPublicationDate": "2025-02-05", "firstPublicationDate": "2025-02-05"}
