### Background

Cholelithiasis, commonly known as gallstones, is a prevalent condition that affects the biliary system and often requires hospitalization [

The pathophysiology of gallstone disease (GSD) involves an abundance of free radicals and oxidative stress, which results in an increase in lipid and protein oxidation products and a decrease in antioxidant enzymes and vitamins [

Research has shown that oxidative stress plays a significant role in the development of gallstones. Gallstone patients have been found to have elevated levels of oxidative stress in the lining of their gallbladders [

Sipos et al. [

McCarty proposed the dietary phytochemical index (DPI) as a way to measure the phytochemical content of diets. Determining this content directly is impractical [

### Methods

### Study population

The study was conducted at the general surgical consultation departments of two major multispecialty hospitals in Baghdad: Al-Yarmook and Al Karama Teaching Hospitals. These hospitals are tertiary care referral centers that receive patients from Baghdad and the surrounding governorates. The study took place between February 2022 and February 2023. It involved 250 patients with gallstones and 250 controls. The selection criteria for cases included being at least 20 years old, willingness to participate in the study, approval from the patient’s guardian (GSD), and a recent diagnosis of gallstones within the past month. Exclusion criteria consisted of a history of other diseases or intestinal disorders, known autoimmune diseases or cancer, pregnancy or lactation in women, changes in the patient’s medication type or dosage, and unwillingness to continue cooperation.

The control group for this study consisted of patients from other departments of the same two hospitals who matched the age and gender criteria. These subjects underwent an ultrasound to confirm that they did not have any gallbladder disorders or liver problems. Data collection for each pair of cases and controls occurred simultaneously, and all participants provided written informed consent. Participants who completed less than 35 items on the food frequency questionnaire and reported an under- or over-reported daily energy intake were excluded. Specifically, participants with a daily energy intake of less than 800 kcal or more than 4500 kcal were not included in the study. Cases and controls were chosen through a random selection process, ensuring that the selection was unbiased and representative of the broader population.

### Physical activity and other variable assessments

Information on age, sex, marital status, socioeconomic status (SES), and current smoking status was obtained using a demographic questionnaire. In the study, we used a Seca scale with an accuracy of 100 g to measure body weight and a Seca stadiometer with an accuracy of 0.5 cm to measure height (Seca Scale Corp., Munich, Germany). We then calculated the body mass index (BMI) by dividing the body weight (in kg) by the square of the height (in m). To assess the physical activity levels of the participants, we conducted interviews using the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and the results were expressed as metabolic equivalent hours per week [

### Dietary assessment

In the study, we used a 168-item unmodified semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to assess dietary intake [

### Phytochemical Index calculation

The Phytochemical Index (PI) was calculated using McCarty’s method. PI is determined by dividing the daily energy obtained from foods rich in phytochemicals (in kilocalories) by the total daily energy intake (in kilocalories), and then multiplying by 100. The food items considered for this calculation include fruits, vegetables (excluding potatoes), legumes (including soy), whole grains, nuts, olives, and olive oil. Natural fruit and vegetable juices, as well as tomato sauces, were also included in the fruit and vegetable categories due to their high phytochemical content. In addition, the PI of each food component (fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, olives) was determined by dividing the energy intake from each component by the total energy consumption [

### Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was conducted using Statistical Package Software for Social Science, version 21 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and

### Results

gallstone patients and controls had mean ± SD values of 16.6 ± 8.2 and 18.1 ± 7.8, respectively.

### Discussion

This case-control study suggested that, a higher PI score is associated with a reduced odds of gallstone. Moreover, the consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, legumes, and olives significantly increased across the tertiles of total PI.

Several studies have found that the phytochemical index (PI) is associated with better health status and a lower risk of various chronic diseases. These diseases include non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [

In a case-control study, Salehi-sahlabadi et al. demonstrated that a higher PI score is linked to a lower risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [

A study conducted by Vincent et al. showed that the PI is negatively associated with adiposity and oxidative stress in healthy young adults. It is also responsive to changes in body weight. This straightforward index could be valuable as a target for consuming nutrient-rich foods in weight reduction or management programs [

Previous studies have investigated the relationship between phytochemical-rich foods (such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts) and the risk of developing gallstones. In a case-control study conducted by Neshatbini et al., it was found that a higher intake of dietary fiber was significantly linked to a lower risk of gallstone disease [

Regarding the sources of PI, individuals in the highest tertile consumed more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and olives compared to those in the lowest tertile. Furthermore, they consumed fewer refined grains, high-fat dairy products, and red and processed meat. Therefore, increasing the consumption of phytochemical-rich foods is likely to have beneficial effects in preventing gallstones. In the past decade, several studies have examined the effects of healthy dietary patterns on gallstones. These patterns are characterized by adequate intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, fish, and nuts, as well as low consumption of hydrogenated fats and salt. These patterns have demonstrated protective effects against gallstones. On the other hand, western dietary patterns, which involve a high intake of processed meat, alcohol, high-fat dairy, hydrogenated fats, and salt, increase the risk of gallstones [

Our study had several strengths. Firstly, it was the first study to investigate the association between dietary PI and the odds of gallstones. Additionally, we also examined the association of each PI component with the risk of gallstones for the first time. Lastly, the use of trained dieticians conducting face-to-face interviews to collect dietary intake data helped to minimize measurement bias.

There were several limitations in our study. First, the case-control study design prevented us from determining cause-and-effect relationships. Second, there may have been measurement error when participants recalled their dietary intake, despite using a validated semi-quantitative FFQ. Additionally, although we adjusted for several potential confounding variables, our study design could not fully eliminate all possible confounding effects. Therefore, there may still be residual confounding variables that could have influenced our results.

### Conclusions

We found evidence of a negative relationship between the dietary phytochemical index and the risk of gallstones, even after accounting for potential confounding variables. As a result, it may be advisable to include more phytochemical-rich foods in dietary approaches aimed at preventing gallstones. However, additional studies are needed to confirm the link between the dietary phytochemical index and gallstone.
