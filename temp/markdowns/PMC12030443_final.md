### 1. Introduction

Phytomedicines have been essential in healthcare for centuries, particularly in regions where traditional medicine remains prevalent. Rooted in ancient civilizations, their therapeutic potential continues to be recognized globally. While modern pharmaceuticals have evolved from these traditional practices, herbal remedies persist due to their abundance of bioactive compounds, which remain essential in therapeutic fields like phytotherapy and aromatherapy [

Medicinal plants exert their pharmacological effects through a diverse array of bioactive compounds, including phenolics, flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenoids, which contribute to their cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and enzyme inhibitory properties [

One such under-researched endemic species is

While the pharmacological properties of several

Using LC-MS/MS, we identified 22 bioactive compounds in the HMeOH extract of

A comparison with the EtOAc and n-BuOH fractions of the HMeOH extract [

To fully exploit the therapeutic potential of these compounds, future research should focus on their mechanisms of action, bioavailability, and potential synergistic interactions. Such studies will enhance our understanding of how to optimize the use of these compounds in medical applications.

### 2.2. Brine Shrimp Cytotoxicity

The cytotoxicity test on

The non-toxic profile of the extracts aligns with their phytochemical composition, which includes compounds with well-documented cytoprotective properties. For instance, the presence of phenolic acids (ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid), as well as flavonoids (rutin, luteolin, epicatechin) in the HMeOH extract, likely contributes to the extract’s safety. Chlorogenic acid, for example, exhibits antioxidant activity by scavenging free radicals and modulating oxidative stress pathways, thereby protecting cells from damage [

EtOAc and n-BuOH extracts contain flavonoids such as naringenin, quercetin, and kaempferol [

The safety profile of

### 2.3. Sun Protection Factor Activity (SPF)

The sun protection factor (SPF) is the most commonly used parameter to measure the sun protection capacity of sunscreens [

In fact, extended exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, especially UVA and UVB rays, can damage the face, neck, head, back of the hands, and other frequently sun exposed areas of the body [

The high SPF values observed in the EtOAc and n-BuOH extracts suggest that these fractions contain bioactive molecules capable of mitigating UV-induced damage through multiple mechanisms.

The phenolic acids present in extracts, including chlorogenic, ferulic, and p-coumaric acid, further enhance SPF activity by stabilizing free radicals and protecting skin cells from lipid peroxidation. Ferulic acid, in particular, has been shown to increase the photostability of sunscreen formulations when combined with other UV filters, suggesting its potential application in natural photoprotective formulations [

Flavonoids such as quercetin, naringenin, and kaempferol, which are abundant in extracts [

Carotenoids such as β-carotene, detected in the EtOAc and n-BuOH extracts [

The synergy between these bioactive molecules explains the significant SPF values recorded in this study, aligning with the photoprotective potential of plant-derived compounds. However, while our in vitro results strongly support the photoprotective potential of these extracts, in vivo confirmation remains essential to validate their efficacy, photostability, and skin penetration under real-world conditions. Future studies should focus on these aspects to further establish

### 2.4. Enzymatic Inhibitory Activities

### 2.4.1. Alpha-Amylase Inhibitory Activity

The α-amylase inhibitory findings are represented in

Diabetes is a chronic epidemic disease that develops when insulin synthesis is insufficient, its secretion is impaired, or its binding to its receptor (IR) on the cell is ineffective, leading to a significant increase in blood glucose levels, thereby damaging the body system [

Synthetic α-amylase inhibitors, such as acarbose, are widely used in diabetes treatment, but often induce gastrointestinal adverse effects that include ulcerations, diarrhea, hernias, and bloating in the abdomen [

This study demonstrated that the n-BuOH extract of

Polyphenols exert their inhibitory effect through hydrogen bonding between their hydroxyl groups and the catalytic residues of α-amylase (e.g., Asp197 and Glu233) as well as hydrophobic interactions with aromatic residues like tryptophan (Trp59), reducing enzymatic activity [

Flavonoids, in particular, inhibit α-amylase by forming stable conjugated π-π interactions between their benzopyrone rings and the indole ring of Trp59, interfering with substrate binding. Structural elements, such as the presence of a C2–C3 double bond, hydroxylation patterns on rings A and B, and additional hydroxyl groups at key positions, significantly influence their inhibitory potency [

Hydroxycinnamic acids contribute to enzyme inhibition through a conjugated system that facilitates electron transport and enhances hydrophobic interactions with the enzyme’s active site. In contrast, hydroxybenzoic acids like salicylic and vanillic acid have shown weak or no inhibitory effects [

These findings suggest that the α-amylase inhibitory activity of

### 2.4.2. Urease Inhibitory Activity

Urease is an enzyme responsible for breaking down urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide through hydrolysis, a process that is crucial for several organisms, including

The urease inhibitory activity of the three extracts from

One possible explanation is the absence or low concentration of key phenolic compounds known for their urease inhibitory properties.

Several potent inhibitors, such as catechin, epigallocatechin gallate, methyl gallate, procyanidins, quercetin, myricetin, luteolin-7-O-glucuronide, 5,7-dihydroxyflavone, and isoflavonoids like genistein, ponciretin, and baicalin, have been identified in previous studies but may not be present in significant amounts in these extracts [

Additionally, while some weaker urease inhibitors such as resveratrol, naringin, epicatechins, and luteolin were detected, their concentrations might have been too low to exert a measurable effect. Another possibility is that the solvent polarity used during extraction was not optimal for isolating the most effective urease-inhibiting compounds.

To address these limitations, future studies should explore alternative extraction methods using different solvents to enhance the recovery of active urease inhibitors. Further quantitative analysis of specific bioactive compounds could also help clarify their contribution to urease inhibition.

### 2.4.3. Tyrosinase Inhibitory Activity

Tyrosinase is an enzyme found in various organisms, including edible mushrooms [

The tyrosinase inhibitory activity of the three extracts was studied, but none of the extracts exhibited significant inhibition (

The extraction process and solvent polarity may have also influenced the presence of these bioactive compounds in the tested extracts. Further studies should focus on optimizing extraction conditions or screening other plant fractions for potential tyrosinase inhibitory activity.

### 3.2. Phytochemical Profile of HMeOH Extract via LC-ESI-MS/MS

The phytochemical composition of the HMeOH extract was analyzed qualitatively at the Technical Platform of Physico-Chemical Analysis (PTAPC-CRAPC) in Ouargla, Algeria, using an ultra-high sensitivity UPLC-ESI-MS-MS (Shimadzu Kyoto, Japan) 8040 equipped with UFMS technology and a Nexera XR LC-20AD binary pump. Separation was achieved using an Ultra-force C18 column (dimensions: 150 mm × 4.6 mm, particle size: 3 μm; Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Chromatographic separation was performed using water with 0.1% formic acid as mobile phase A and methanol as mobile phase B. The following gradient elution program was applied: A (98%) 0 min to 0.2 min, A (25%) 0.2 min to 7.5 min, A (0%) 7.5 min to 12.5min, A (0%) 12.5 min to 17 min, A (98%) 17 min to 18min, A (98%) 18 min to 21 min. The flow rate was 0.2 mL/min, the injection volume was 5 μL, and the column temperature was set to 30 °C. The ESI conditions for electro spray ionization were as follows: 230 KPs of CID gas; −6.00 kV conversion dynode; 350 °C interface temperature; 250 °C DL temperature; 3.00 L/min nebulization gas flow; 400 °C heat block temperature; and 10.00 L/min drying gas flow [

The same conditions were maintained without the tested extracts, serving as a negative control, while the potassium dichromate was used as a positive control. After 24 h, the surviving shrimps were counted.
