### 3.3. Relationship Between Bioactive Compounds, Biological Activities, and Medicinal Uses

These compounds include flavonoids, phenolic acids, iridoids, anthraquinones, saponins, and essential oils. They exhibit significant biological activity and exert numerous beneficial effects on various human body systems, including the central nervous, hepatobiliary, renal, gastrointestinal, and urinary systems. Their therapeutic potential is largely attributed to their preventive actions, including antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, and immunomodulatory properties.
