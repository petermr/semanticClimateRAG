### Introduction

Recently, there has been a notable increase in the use of natural drug compounds in the field of medicine. Functional foods and nutraceuticals have garnered significant attention for their beneficial medicinal and nutritional properties. In order to expand the variety of natural compounds available, it is essential to focus on plants that indigenous to their native ecosystems. Iran, with its diverse climate, stands out as one of the most biodiverse regions worldwide, hosting a rich array of biological and genetic diversity

The climate of Iran provides ideal conditions for the growth of the Apiaceae family, supported by the presence of numerous wild plant species

The Apiaceae family consists of valuable aromatic plants used in many industries including food, perfume, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and cosmeceuticals. Some species are popular worldwide as flavorings, seasonings, colorants, and even preservatives

Essential oils (EOs), which are concentrated liquids containing volatile components with aromatic properties, are extracted from different plant parts. The quality and quantity of essential oil can be influenced by various factors, such as genetics, nutrition, sunlight, temperature, humidity, location, and harvesting time

Although valuable information exists on essential oil samples from wild carrot, no studies have examined the genotypes of its populations in Iran, a region considered a potential origin of

### Essential oil (EO) content, compositions, chemo-typing and correlation

The essential oils (EOs) displayed a spectrum of colors, ranging from colorless to pale yellow, and each exhibited varying scent intensities. The primary reason for the observed differences in color among the EO samples is likely the alteration of their chemical compounds across the evaluated populations

According to the GC and GC–MS analyses, a total of 23 distinct compositions were identified, which together accounted for approximately 88.49% to 95.5% of the EOs (Table

### Total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC)

The analysis of total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) across various locations revealed significant variations (p < 0.05). Among the aerial parts (AP), the highest TPC was observed in sample

### Antioxidant activity

The DPPH free radical scavenging activity for aerial parts (AP) was highest (53.25%) in samples from

### Antibacterial activity

The antibacterial activity of extracts derived from various populations of wild carrot was evaluated against two bacterial strains:

### Correlations, and multivariate and regression analysis with combined data

The study aimed to examine the relationship between phytochemical traits and their antioxidant and antibacterial properties by using a Mantel Test correlation matrix (Fig.

Correlation analysis is a valuable tool for exploring the relationships between various traits, with significant implications for plant breeding and domestication practices. Figure

Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) is a multivariate statistical method utilized to investigate the relationships between two sets of variables. In this study, CCA was applied to analyze the associations between phytochemical and environmental attributes (climatic and soil factors). CCA was done in a sample of 118 genotypes sourced from 5 distinct populations. This type of analysis explains the relationships between traits by forming Canonical Correspondence (CCs), and the contribution of each canonical correspondence is determined by the Eigenvalues and the percentage of variance obtained.

To further investigate the diversity of phytochemical and morphological traits among the populations, a cluster analysis was performed using R software with a circular clustering approach (Fig.

Stepwise regression is a statistical technique employed in linear regression analysis to identify a subset of relevant independent variables for inclusion in a model

The analysis of wild carrot populations revealed that the plant serves as a significant source of carotol. This compound, a type of oxygenated sesquiterpene, found in higher percentage in the studied populations. The importance of oxygenated sesquiterpenes has been recognized in various biological activities, including insecticidal, antioxidant, and allelopathic effects

The present study identified three valuable chemotypes, categorized as follows:

Studies on wild carrot have revealed significant geographic variation in the composition of essential oils across different plant tissues. In aerial parts sourced from Turkey, key compounds such as carotol (27%), elemicin (18.1%), and limonene (16%) were identified as major constituents

These chemotypes, exhibiting strong antioxidant and antibacterial activity, hold promise for development as new nutraceuticals and functional foods, contingent upon further supplementary studies. Additionally, to scale up production, domestication and breeding strategies should be considered. This study highlights the significant antibacterial properties of plant extracts from various populations, particularly DCP5 and DCP3, which exhibited enhanced levels of carotol, α-pinene, phenolic, and flavonoid compounds. The significant antibacterial effects of phenolic and flavonoid compounds have been reported in previous studies as well

### Methods

### Plant materials, soil samples and climatic characterization

To obtain the plant material, the aerial parts of

To determine the physicochemical properties of the soil in five study areas, soil samples were collected by excavating profiles to a depth of 0 to 30 cm from three different locations within each area. Soil analyses included the determination of soil texture, pH, and electrical conductivity (EC) following the method outlined previously

### Essential oil isolation, GC/MS analysis, and identification

Essential oil extraction was performed using the water distillation method with a Clavenger apparatus for a duration of three hours. For this means, 35 g of dried plant material was pulverized and combined with 650 ml of water in a specifically designed flask for the apparatus, facilitating the oil extraction process. The volume of the extracted essential oil was directly read from the graduated collector tube. The oils were subsequently stored in sealed glass vials, placed within a dark glass container, and refrigerated for preservation at 4 °C.

The gas chromatography apparatus used was a Shimadzu model A9, manufactured in Japan. It was equipped with a HP-5MS, 30 m × 0.250 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness non-polar fused silica capillary column. The temperature programming commenced at an initial temperature of 60 °C, gradually increasing to a final temperature of 210 °C at a rate of 3 °C per min. Subsequently, the temperature increased to a secondary final temperature of 240 °C over a period of 20 min. The injector and detector chamber temperatures were maintained at 280 °C. Helium gas, with a purity of 99.999%, served as the carrier gas, flowing through the column at a rate of 1 ml/min. For the gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, a Varian 3400 model DB-1 ion trap mass spectrometer was employed. It featured a column of DB-1, 60 m × 0.250 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness. The thermal programming of the column varied from an initial temperature of 50 °C to a final temperature of 280 °C, at an increment of 4 °C per minute. The injector chamber temperature was set to 10 °C higher than the final column temperature. Helium served as the carrier gas, flowing at a rate of 1 ml/min through the column. The scan time was set to one second, with an ionization energy of 70 electron volts and a mass range from 40 to 340. A volume of 0.2 µl from each essential oil sample was injected into the gas chromatography (GC) system, employing a split ratio of 1:60. The percentage composition of the individual compounds present in each essential oil was calculated using the area normalization method, without considering response factors. To assess the retention indices of the compounds, a mixture of normal hydrocarbons ranging from C8 to C22 was injected into the GC under the same conditions as those utilized for the essential oil samples. The identification of the constituents of the essential oils was conducted by analyzing the retention indices, examining the mass spectra of the compounds, and comparing them with standard mass spectra available in computer databases and reputable literature (Shibamato, 1987; Davies, 1990).

### Methanolic extracts

The aerial parts and seed samples of various genotypes were extracted separately using an ultrasonic device. One gram of each ground sample was placed in 50-ml Falcon tubes, to which 20 ml of 80% methanol was added. The mixture was then subjected to ultrasonic treatment for 20 min at 40 °C and a frequency of 37 kHz using an Elmasonic E 120 H ultrasonic cleaner (Elma Schmidbauer GmbH, Germany). Following extraction, the resulting mixtures were filtered through Whatman filter paper and stored at 4 °C for further analysis.

### Determination of total phenolic and flavonoid content

The measurement of phenolic compounds was conducted using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. A volume of 25 µl of the extracted solution was taken and placed in a Falcon tube. Next, 180 µl s of distilled water was added to the extract. Following this, 1200 µl of 10% Folin reagent was added to the mixture, after which 7.5% sodium carbonate was introduced after a 5 min interval. The samples were then allowed to stand in the dark at room temperature for 45 min. Finally, the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 760 nm using a spectrophotometer (Model: UV2100 PC). Deionized water served as the blank, while gallic acid was used as the standard. A standard curve was constructed based on gallic acid, and the results were reported as mg of gallic acid equivalents per g of dry weight (mg GA E /g DW) of the plant

### DPPH free radical scavenging assay

To measure antioxidant activity using the DPPH method, a specific volume of methanolic extract (30 µL) was placed in a test tube, and then 2000 µL of DPPH solution (prepared at a concentration of 0.002 g in 60 mL of 80% methanol) was added. The resulting solution was mixed and allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min. Absorbance was then measured at 517 nm using a spectrophotometer. For the blank control, the same procedure was followed, but instead of the extract, 50 µL of 80% ethanol was used

The formula used to calculate the percentage of DPPH inhibition is as follows (Eq.

### Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay

The extracts of the samples were mixed with 3 mL of freshly prepared FRAP reagent (300 mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 3.6, a solution of 10 mM TPTZ (Tripyridyl-s-triazine), in 40 mM HCl and 20 mM ferric chloride (FeCl
