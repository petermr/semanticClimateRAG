### 1. Introduction

Shrub encroachment is the phenomenon where native shrub and woody plant species increase in density, cover, and biomass beyond their historical or geographical ranges [

Allelopathy is often referred to as any effect, either direct or indirect, positive or negative, of one species on the development of another via the release of chemical compounds into the environment [

In this study, we investigate the phytochemical classes in the leaves and twigs of

The encroachment of

### 2. Materials and Methods

### 2.1. Plant Material Collection in the Field

In this study, we selected leaves and twigs, as they are the primary plant parts exposed to environmental factors and are likely to release allelopathic compounds either through leaching by rain or through the decomposition of leaves and twig debris after falling to the ground [

### 2.2. Handling and Preparation of Plant Parts

In the laboratory, the collected leaf and twig samples were first unpacked from the paper bags and carefully inspected for any debris or contaminants. Leaf and twig samples were then air-dried at room temperature for two weeks. The air-dried leaves and twigs were then ground to powder using a waring commercial laboratory blender. The prepared leaf and twig samples were then stored in airtight containers and kept refrigerated at 4 °C for less than a week before the experiment.

### 2.3. Phytochemical Analysis

### 2.3.1. Phytochemical Screening in the Laboratory

The analysis was performed to detect the presence of various phytochemical classes. For this purpose, 50 g of milled leaf material and 50 g of twig material were each macerated in 500 mL of tap water at a ratio of 1:10 (

### 2.3.2. Quantitative Analysis of Phytochemicals

From the screened phytochemicals, total tannins, total phenolics, and total flavonoids were selected for quantification based on their known bioactive properties and allelopathic effects [

### Total Phenolic Content (TPC)

Using the Folin–Ciocalteau method, the total phenolic content (TPC) amount in the acetone-dissolved extract was determined using a previously published protocol [

### Total Tannin Content (TTC)

The Folin–Ciocalteau method was used to determine the tannin content [

### Total Flavonoid Content (TFC)

The previously reported procedure [

### 2.4.1. Preparation of Aqueous Extracts for Bioassays

Leaf and twig extracts were prepared by adding 25 g and 50 g of air-dried material from each plant part to 1 L of distilled water [

### 2.4.2. Laboratory Bioassays for Allelopathic Evaluation

To explore the allelopathic potential of

Germination rate (GR):

Germination index (GI):

Seed vigour index (SVI):

To evaluate the intensity of allelopathic effect, allelopathic response index (RI) was determined using the following formula [

### 3. Statistical Analysis

The normality of the data was evaluated using the Shapiro–Wilk test, and the homogeneity of variances were assessed by Levene’s test. Owing to the lack of normal distribution, the Kruskal–Wallis test was employed to investigate the influence of

### 5.1. Phytochemicals of Leaf and Twigs of E. floribundus

Phytochemicals, also referred to as secondary metabolites, are naturally occurring bioactive chemical compounds found in plants [

Additionally, the higher concentrations of phytochemical classes in the leaves of
